              Software Developers at C4C are responsible for creating and
              maintaing software products for our partner organizations.
              Developers work in AGILE, collaboartive teams and are exposed to
              every aspect of the product development cycle. Developers can
              expect to spend roughly 5 hours a week working collaborating on
              tickets and have ths ability to specialize in QA, DevOps, or
              project management.

              A great developer is someone who is highly motivated and willing
              to learn. Although exposure to software development practices
              through co-ops, internships, or personal projects, is a big plus,
              we ultimately value the passion to improve as a software
              developer. We don't believe coding challenges belong in our
              interview process, and we never factor school year into our
              decisions. The ideal candidate is passionate about developing and
              learns from their team and empowers the developers around them.
