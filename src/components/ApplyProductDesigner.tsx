              Product Designers are the main stakeholders for the design/UI of
              our projects. As a designer, you'll get to work with our software
              developers to create intuitive, user friendly products that meet
              the needs of our non profit partners and their members. You'll
              have the creative freedom to own, iterate, and improve the product
              using the feedback from our product teams and partners to achieve
              a high quality user experience. While your journey will start with
              mock-ups of the product, you will be continuously reiterating at
              different fidelity levels to ensure that the designs are
              translatable to working, codable products.
