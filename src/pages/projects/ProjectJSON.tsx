            or other life-threatening illnesses with integrative therapies like massage, meditation,
            acupuncture, music therapy, and therapeutic horseback riding. Integrative therapies ease children’s
            pain and anxiety during and after traditional medical treatments.
            The Sajni Center is a space of hope and healing for children with life-threatening illness or chronic
            medical conditions and their families. Here they host events for the children and their families. We created

            C4C built a block reservation system, allowing SFFT's volunteers to reserve blocks of trees that they will
            be able to inventory and then mark them as complete when they are finished collecting the required data.`,
